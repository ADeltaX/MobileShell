### Running on a phone:

## What's new:

- Battery status (charging, normal, saving)
- Detects (like w10m):
    - Focus Assist
    - Location usage
    - WiFi (expected to be partially broken)
    - Cellular (+ dual sim)
    - It may bug explorer.exe, in that case open Task Manager, kill MobileShell, go in Desktop mode and launch MobileShell again.
- Double tap to sleep
- Rotation - DPI - display changes
- Follows theme colors (currently at launch only)
- Faster (?)

## Issues:
- It's an alpha, expect some issues.
